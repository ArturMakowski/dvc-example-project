    "# What Is Data Version Control?\n",
    "\n",
    "In standard software engineering, many people need to work on a shared codebase and handle multiple versions of the same code. This can quickly lead to confusion and costly mistakes.\n",
    "\n",
    "To address this problem, developers use version control systems, such as Git, that help keep team members organized.\n",
    "\n",
    "In a version control system, there’s a central repository of code that represents the current, official state of the project. A developer can make a copy of that project, make some changes, and request that their new version become the official one. Their code is then reviewed and tested before it’s deployed to production.\n",
    "\n",
    "These quick feedback cycles can happen many times per day in traditional development projects. But similar conventions and standards are largely missing from commercial data science and machine learning. Data version control is a set of tools and processes that tries to adapt the version control process to the data world.\n",
    "\n",
    "Having systems in place that allow people to work quickly and pick up where others have left off would increase the speed and quality of delivered results. It would enable people to manage data transparently, run experiments effectively, and collaborate with others.\n"
